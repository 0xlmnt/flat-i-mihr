# flat-i-mihr API

Some soon to be REST API for.. yea dont really know what for.
It's definately a REST API tho - and it's even gonna do typical API things as well. Like APIing API Calls n shit.

It even has a fockn LICENSE! 
Like big ol jesus' once said: The absence of a license shall be punished by a stick of butter up the programmers rear end. 
While that may be an enjoyable experience we decided to postpone this happening to another date by including said license file.
